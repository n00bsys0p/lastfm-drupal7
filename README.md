lastfm-drupal7
==============

A module for Drupal 7, which provides blocks for the display of both a user's recent plays and top artists.

To use it, you need a [Last.FM API key](http://www.last.fm/api/account). This should be filled in within the
Last.FM configuration page, found at admin/config/media/lastfm.

Install it like any other Drupal module. For a live demo, check out [the Flow Arts page on my website](http://n00bsys0p.co.uk/flowarts).
